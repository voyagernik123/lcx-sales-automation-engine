# THE PRODUCTION — LEDGER (the second brain)

Plan: `VFX_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md`. Owner approval: 2026-09-02, in advance, end to end, solo, no subagents, "even if it takes
days". This file is the only state that survives a context window. Write here before pushing; read here before building.

## 0 · RESUME PROTOCOL — do this on any fresh context, in order

1. Read this file top to bottom (it is short by design).
2. Read the phase marked **IN PROGRESS** in §2, then that phase's section in `VFX_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` §3.
3. Read memory `vfx-production-plan.md` and `hard-rule-finish-the-work.md`.
4. Check the tree: `git status --short`, `git log --oneline -3`. If dirty, §5's last entry says what was mid-flight.
5. Continue from the **NEXT ACTION** line in §2. Do not re-plan. Do not re-run §1's baseline.
6. Every gate from the repo ROOT: `npm run ci-check` — a log without five stage
   totals is not a gate. Push `git push lcx-sales dev:main`. Verify with `scratchpad/verify-live.sh <sha> …` (recreate from
   §3 if the scratchpad is gone) and the GitHub deployments API for Render.
7. Regenerate the gallery every phase and LOOK at every capture before writing "done".

## 1 · BASELINE (P0 fills this — cite, never re-run)

| metric | before (P0, HEAD 2c437c5, 2026-09-02) |
|---|---|
| routes with any GL visible (coverage > 5%), dark | **3 of 79** (`/select` 95%, `/ontology` 58%, `/bd-pipeline` 16%) |
| routes with any GL visible, light | **4 of 79** |
| median glCoverage over 79 routes, dark / light | **0% / 0%** |
| routes carrying a GL environment (static) | 7 of 80 |
| GL contexts at rest (as shipped, fixtures on, reliefs at default) | 3 |
| default theme | light |
| frame time of the heaviest hero at 2× (probe) | not yet measured — the redraw contract lands with the stage (P1) |
| gallery | `docs/vfx/GALLERY.md`, 316 WebP thumbnails, 2.9 MB |

The harness aborts `/v1/**` and fixtures exist for the eight desks only, so data-driven heroes on other routes
(`/market-map`'s globe, `/audit-log`'s vault, `/deal-board`'s surface) read 0% here although they draw in production
with data. P4 adds hero fixtures so the judge sees them; until then their 0 is a harness limit, stated, not a finding.

## 2 · STATUS — exactly one row IN PROGRESS

| Phase | Status | Commit | Measured after | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 GALLERY + VISIBILITY INSTRUMENT | **BUILT · gate running** | — | `docs/vfx/GALLERY.md` + `docs/instrument/audit/production-p0/` | baseline: GL visible on 3/79 dark, 4/79 light; median 0%; controls 40.0% and 0 |
| P1 DARK FIRST + THE STAGE | PENDING | | | |
| P2 THE CAMERA MOVES | PENDING | | | |
| P3 THE FIDELITY STACK | PENDING | | | |
| P4 THE EIGHT HEROES (+ desktop 0.4.0) | PENDING | | | |
| P5 GPU CHARTS EVERYWHERE | PENDING | | | |
| P6 THE OBJECTS (glTF) | PENDING | | | |
| P7 LIVENESS | PENDING | | | |
| P8 HARDENING | PENDING | | | |
| P9 PRODUCTION GATE + RELEASE | PENDING | | | |

**NEXT ACTION (2026-09-02):** P0. Extend `scripts/instrument-audit.mjs`: (1) a second capture per route×theme with GL
forced off (init script sets `window.__LCX_GL_OFF = true`; the stage and every relief read it and refuse with code
`FORCED_OFF_FOR_MEASUREMENT`; relief prefs also seeded off), (2) `glCoverage` = share of viewport pixels whose RGB
distance between the two captures exceeds 8/255, `glDelta` = mean ΔE76 over changed pixels, (3) positive control (a
route with a known GL rectangle) and negative control (a DOM-only route → 0%), (4) `docs/vfx/GALLERY.md` writer with WebP
thumbnails under `docs/vfx/gallery/` (≤ 60 KB each, committed), (5) a GL frame-time probe (force a redraw N times via
`window.__LCX_GL_REDRAW?.()` where a surface exposes it; report ms/frame). Then the baseline sweep both themes → §1 →
commit → push → present the plan with the baseline number.

## 3 · STANDING RULES (from the previous programs; every one still binds)

- One clock: `lib/clock.ts` is the only `setInterval`; rAF only inside bounded tweens or on-demand redraws; at rest 0.
- One material: DOM scenery tokens are GENERATED from `packages/gl/src/look/theme.ts` (`npm run gen:tokens -w apps/web`).
- Brand hex is decided from the bytes (`docs/3d/brand-fidelity.mjs`; S7's `scripts/blender/brand_hex.py`), never from a
  shader's intent. The tone map moves brand blue ΔE76 18.3 unless precompensated — `look/precompensate.ts`.
- Contrast floors (`lib/__tests__/contrast.test.ts`) outrank any look. New dark-overridden tokens need print pins
  (`components/report/PrintStyles.tsx`) or two print ratchets go red.
- Refusals are honest: `createStage` returns a discriminated union; every caller handles it. Never fabricate data.
- Every GL byte is lazy; initial JS ≤ 850 KB (`perf-budget`); GL budget test pins the routes at cap.
- Instrument: `INSTRUMENT_FIXTURES=1` for the eight desks; `INSTRUMENT_ROUTES=` for subsets; never run two instrument
  sweeps or a sweep and a gate concurrently when timing is being read.
- The gate is the root `ci-check`. CI is the backstop and runs e2e — OPEN THE RUN, never infer it.
- Verify live by content needles + deployment SHA; Pages serves index.html for missing assets (a 200 proves nothing).
- Solo. No subagents, no workflows. Commit per phase with measured before/after in the body.

## 5 · CHECKPOINT LOG — append-only, newest last

- 2026-09-02 · **PLAN WRITTEN** after the owner's ruling: the INSTRUMENT program "unslopified" the platform but he wants
  visible, high-fidelity 3D/VFX across every route. Grounding read: engine = `packages/gl` 16,569 lines (lit GGX/aniso,
  shadow maps, sky IBL, DoF, AO, particles, volumes, bloom composite + precompensation, flat charts, quality tiers,
  motion); no glTF loader, procedural sky only, no SMAA; 7 routes carry GL (`/ontology /bd-pipeline /deal-board
  /market-map /audit-log /marketing/crisis /command-deck`) + `/select` Forge; reliefs default ON except storm; theme
  default light (`useUIStore.darkMode: false`); 12 chart components (~20 sites), 4 GL flat renderers, 35 files with
  inline data SVG; the old backdrop slot is `AppLayout` `relative isolate` (X1 comment); initial JS 828/850.
- 2026-09-02 · **P0 BUILT** (instrument only; the tree's app code untouched). `createStage` gains the refusal
  `FORCED_OFF_FOR_MEASUREMENT` on `window.__LCX_GL_OFF`; the instrument captures every reached route×theme twice and
  measures in a lab page in Chromium (no PNG decoder in Node): `glCoverage` = share of viewport pixels with any channel
  > 8/255 apart, `glDelta` = mean ΔE76 over them; 400 px WebP thumbnails to `docs/vfx/gallery/`; `GALLERY.md` written
  from the JSON. Controls: a 800×500 GL canvas in a 1000×1000 viewport read **40.0%**; identical captures read 0.
  Reliefs stay at their SHIPPED defaults in the shipped capture (`INSTRUMENT_RELIEFS_OFF=1` restores S6's reading).
  Four-route check: `/select` 95/96%, `/ontology` 18/36%, `/bd-pipeline` 35/43%, `/market-map` 0/0% (the globe needs
  API data the harness aborts — P4 adds hero fixtures so the judge can see data-driven heroes). Baseline sweep running.
- 2026-09-02 · **P1 SPEC (settled before building; drafts in scratchpad `p1/`).** (1) `packages/gl/src/env/stageScene.ts`:
  pure — `invert`, `unprojectToPlane`, `rectToNdc`, `slabGeometry` (the DOM content rect unprojected onto y=PLATE_Y and
  extruded), `roomPositions` (8 on an arc behind the plate), `roomGlow` (bounded by the watch's `byWorkspace[room].changed`;
  unheld = unlit), `STAGE_VIEW`, `STAGE_KEY_DIR`, `STAGE_LUMINANCE_MAX = {dark .12, light .96}`. (2)
  `components/stage/Stage.tsx`: one context, dynamic engine imports (Forge pattern), frames ON DEMAND (mount, class
  change, ResizeObserver on host + `[data-stage-plate]`, arrival store, route) coalesced into one rAF → allowlisted in
  `oneClock.test.ts`; sky → shadow pass → lit ground + slab (fog) → additive glows (points, `lo/hi` brand blue) →
  present (tone map + encode); `data-stage="drawn|refused:<code>"`. (3) Shell: `<Stage />` first child of the
  `relative isolate` root (the X1 slot; `bg-page` stays as the honest fallback beneath); `MainContent` gets
  `data-stage-plate` + `m-2 rounded-xl border-line/60` + `GLASS_PLATE_CLASS`; TopNav/Sidebar `bg-card` →
  `GLASS_CHROME_CLASS`. (4) `lib/glass.ts` alphas (light .86/.92, dark .80/.90) + `glass.test.ts`: literals match; every
  text role ≥ 4.5:1 over composite(card·α over STAGE_LUMINANCE_MAX) both themes. (5) Dark default: `useUIStore`
  `darkMode: true` with persist `version: 1` + `migrate` flipping stored `false` → true ONCE (existing operators
  persisted the old default; their next toggle persists at v1); index.html pre-hydration adds `dark` unless the stored
  state says `darkMode: false` (the body attr keeps the LIGHT hex as the no-JS fallback so `oneMaterial.test` holds).
  (6) `glContextBudget.test.ts` CAP 1 → 2 (stage + one hero) with the measured route set. (7) Gate: coverage ≥ 35%
  dark / ≥ 20% light on every seated route; contrast + glass green; rAF at rest 0; initial JS unchanged.
- 2026-09-02 · **P0 BASELINE SWEPT** (79 routes × 2 themes × 2 captures, fixtures ON, reliefs at shipped defaults; HEAD
  2c437c5): GL visible on **3 of 79** routes in dark (`/select` 95%, `/ontology` 58%, `/bd-pipeline` 16%) and **4 of 79**
  in light; median coverage **0%** both themes; GL contexts at rest 3. Gallery: 316 thumbnails, 2.9 MB, committed.
  This is the honest starting picture — the owner's "things look exactly the same" as a number. Gate running for the
  P0 commit; P1 applies from scratchpad `p1/` the moment it is clean.
